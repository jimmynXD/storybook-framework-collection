## Bumping changesets

- `pnpm run build`
  - Build all the projects first in the root directory
    - we use `turbo` to cache the builds so it doesn't build if there are no changes
- `changeset`
  - minor only
- `changeset version`
  - this will bump the version of the packages
- Make sure you are logged into our npm `mskcc` registry before running `changeset publish`.

## Prepublishing

- `changeset pre enter edge`
  - this will enter prerelease mode `edge`
- `changeset version`
  - this will bump the version of the packages
- commit your changes now
- `changeset publish`
  - this will publish the packages with the prerelease tag
- `changeset pre exit`
  - this will exit prerelease mode
- `git push --follow-tags`
  - this will push the tags to github

## Tags

`changeset tag` will create a tag for the current version of the packages. Tags
are also created when you run `changeset publish`. You will need to push those
tags via `git push --follow-tags`.
