# UI Compoonents

House all your components here for reusability within nuxt3 projects. The package is configured to auto-import into a nuxt3 project.

## Get started

Install package into your nuxt3 project. Add this module into your project's `nuxt.config.ts` file.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    ...
    modules: ['ui-local'],
})

```

## Development

All components will live inside `components` directory. Use `msk-tile` as an example.

## TODO

- generator to create new component
