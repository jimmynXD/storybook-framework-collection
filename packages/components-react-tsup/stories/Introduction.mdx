## Create your component libary

`components` directory is where you will build your components. The injection
file is located at `components/index.ts`. When building your component (e.g.
Button.tsx), we use namespace exporting so that we only need to import it inside
the `index.ts` file.

```typescript
// components/Button.tsx
export function Button() {
  ...
}

// components/index.ts
export * from './Button';
```

When someone wants to use it, they would import it into their file like so:

```typescript
import { Button } from '@msk/team-components';
```

## Storybook

Storybook configurations are located inside `.storybook` directory. By default,
we have a `stories` folder in the root of your project. This is where you should
put your stories. We have a package `@mskcc/storybook-assets` that houses our
storybook styles. You will see it used within the configurations as well as
stories itself.

- `.storybook/preview.ts` - for preview (component) panel. Add global
  stylesheets or any other attributes that you want to exist in all stories.
- `.storybook/manager.ts` - for manager (sidebar) panel. We have our team
  injected there.
- `.storybook/main.ts` - for Storybook configurations. You can define a
  different path for your stories here.
  - `.storybook/manager-head.html` - escape hatch for injecting stylesheets into
    the manager panel.

### Creating Stories

We have two templates for you to build off of:

- story-level.stories.ts
- component-level.stories.ts

### Storybook Global Stylesheets

You can import a global stylesheet inside `.storybook/preview.ts`. By defauolt,
we include:

- css reset
- font files
  - gotham
  - source sans pro
  - msk sans pro
  - redhat mono
- helpers
- typography
- msk icons

### Storybook Badges

You can specify the state of your component with badges. We have the following
pre-defined:

- STABLE = "stable",
- NEEDS_DESIGN = "needs-design",
- NEEDS_UX = "needs-ux-review",
- REVIEW_BRAND = "needs-brand-review",
- REVIEW_DEV = "needs-dev-review",
- EXPERIMENTAL = "experimental",
- DEPRECATED = "deprecated"

To use them, simply add the badge to the `Meta` component or directly to a
specific component variation:

```typescript
// story level
import { BADGES } from "@mskcc/storybook-assets";

const meta: Meta<typeof Banner> = {
  parameters: {
    badges: [BADGES.EXPERIMENTAL],
  },
  ...
};
```

```typescript
// component level
import { BADGES } from "@mskcc/storybook-assets";

export const Primary: Story = {
  args: {
    ...
  },
};

Primary.parameters = {
  badges: [BADGES.STABLE],
};
```
